# Dave Wilder: Portfolio Site

Circa 2014, updated 2024 for relaunch. A clean and simple portfolio site highlighting designs and development skills. It's meant to be concise.

## Code

The side is built on PHP for simple templating and basic functions (eg. updating the copyright data).

CSS is compiled from Sass using `compass watch`. Refer to the [official documentation](http://beta.compass-style.org/install/) for all the details on installing compass, or just run `gem install compass` from the CLI.
